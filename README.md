# Exploratory Data Analysis
Our group conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of financial metrics related to JP Moragn & Chase's stock price over the last 45 years.

Built with Python.

### JP Morgan & Chase Historical Stock Prices (1980 - 2025)

There are 7 key metrics tracked in this dataset.
* **Date** of the trading day in question
* **Open** refers to the stock price at market open
* **Close** refers to the stock price at market close
* **High** is the highest price that JPM stock traded for the date
* **Low** is the lowest price that JPM stock traded for the date
* **Adj_close** is the adjusted stock closing price
* **Volume** is the total number of stock shares traded on the date

We picked this dataset for a number of reasons. First, its suitability for an introductory EDA was undeniable. Second, the relevance of JP Morgan as a financial insitution is indisbutable. And finally and most significantly, we aimed to examine a dataset through the lens of fraud detection, and this dataset is perfect for that. It has the core ingredients: open, high, low, close, volume â€” the very metrics traders and regulators use to spot pump-and-dump schemes, insider trading, or algorithmic manipulation.
